# us-births

This is a guided project from Dataquest.io using US Births data from fivethirtyeight.com. Although I'm aware that the pandas and numpy packages make much of what was performed here less intensive from a code perspective, this project solely uses built-in Python data structures (lists and dictionaries). 

Within the Jupyter notebook, I do the following: 
* Convert csv data into a list of lists. 
* Create a generalized counter function to compute basic summary statistics. 
* Create a function that calculates min and max values for a given column, and notes the respective years. 
* Create a function that calculates the difference between consecutive values. 

The notebook goes much more in-depth, so explore it if you have a chance.
